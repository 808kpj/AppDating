Starting up an .Net Core Web API Controller project

1.Ensure you have all dependency for .Net core installed
	Open Command line and type dontnet --info, if you see installation information you are set if not download it from Microsoft website.

2. while in the main project folder not the API folder yet,Create the solution container to hold the .Net Project
	type "dotnet new sln" in the terminal

3. Now create the API project, this command will create/name the project folder and set up the structure based on the command passed
	type "dotnet new webapi -controllers -n API

	-controllers is the type of structure the .NET CLI will generate
	-n is the name the CLI will give the folder

4. Add the project to the dotnet solution
	type "dotnet sln add API" API will be whatever name you chose to use but for best practice I hope you just named it API...

	Troubleshooting:
	
	if the server dont trust the default certs when running the api server run this command in the terminal
		type "dotnet dev-certs https --trust"
		
	if that dont work change trust to clean and try this.
		type "dotnet dev-certs https --clean"
