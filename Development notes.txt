Starting up an .Net Core Web API Controller project

	1.Ensure you have all dependency for .Net core installed
		Open Command line and type dontnet --info, if you see installation information you are set if not download it from Microsoft website.

	2. while in the main project folder not the API folder yet,Create the solution container to hold the .Net Project
		type "dotnet new sln" in the terminal

	3. Now create the API project, this command will create/name the project folder and set up the structure based on the command passed
		type "dotnet new webapi -controllers -n API

		-controllers is the type of structure the .NET CLI will generate
		-n is the name the CLI will give the folder

	4. Add the project to the dotnet solution
		type "dotnet sln add API" API will be whatever name you chose to use but for best practice I hope you just named it API...

		Troubleshooting:
		
		if the server dont trust the default certs when running the api server run this command in the terminal
			type "dotnet dev-certs https --trust"
			
		if that dont work change trust to clean and try this.
			type "dotnet dev-certs https --clean"
			
		
Using entity framework:
	
	1.set up the folder structure, add Data folder to the project then make DataContext.cs file within the folder
	
	2.add the connection string in the appsetting.development.Json file, will look like this:
	
		  "ConnectionStrings":{
		"DefaultConnection": "Data source=dating.db"
		}
	
	3.add the service to the program.cs file. Will look something like this:
	
		builder.Services.AddDbContext<DataContext>( opt =>
		{
			//the connection string, allows you to talk to the database
			
			opt.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));
		});
		
		DataContext - is the class file that will hold the dbSets 
		DefaultConnection - is the string representation of the connection string that is stored within the appsetting.development.Json
			
	4. Check to see if dotnet-ef is up to date open the console
		type "dotnet tool list - g"
		
		it should be the same main version of your .Net core project if not update it here: 
			https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-ef/10.0.0-preview.4.25258.110#versions-body-tab
	
	5. To create an intiation migration open the console
		type "dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -o Data/Migrations"
